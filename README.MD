# Tree-Based Regression Methods for 3D Sinusoidal Data: A Comparative Analysis

## Directions and Overview

The main purpose of this assignment is for you to gain experience using tree-based methods to solve simple regression problems. In this assignment, you will fit a `Gradient-Boosted Regression Tree`, a `Random Forest`, and a `Decision Tree` to a noisy 3D sinusoidal data set. Since these models can be trained very quickly on the supplied data, you will first manually adjust hyperparameter values and observe their influence on the model's predictions. This involves manually sweeping the hyperparameter space and attempting to hone in on the optimal hyperparameter values through a process of guess-and-check: pick some values, train the model, observe the prediction curve, and repeat.

### Objectives

1. **Manual Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
   - Gain an intuitive understanding of how altering hyperparameters affects model predictions.
   - Manually adjust hyperparameter values for `Gradient-Boosted Regression Tree`, `Random Forest`, and `Decision Tree` models.
   - Observe and analyze the influence of hyperparameter changes on the prediction curves.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train models with manually chosen hyperparameter values.
   - Compare manually tuned hyperparameter values with those obtained from grid searches.
   - Visualize model predictions and evaluate their performance.

3. **Grid Search for Optimal Hyperparameters**:
   - Perform grid searches to determine optimal hyperparameter values for each model.
   - Compare and contrast the performance of models with grid-searched hyperparameters.

4. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Visualize model predictions for the optimal `Gradient-Boosted Regression Tree`, `Random Forest`, and `Decision Tree` models.
   - Compute and analyze the generalization error on the test set for all three models.
   - Critically analyze and characterize the trends observed in the prediction results.

### Learning Outcomes
